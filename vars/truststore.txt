Starts copies and provides a truststore files for safe use over different Jenkins nodes. When the build job finishes there
will be no truststore file left in the Jenkins workspace.

By default Jenkins's truststore will be used: `/var/lib/jenkins/truststore.jks`

(optional) Parameters:

- pathToTruststore - This path pointing to the truststore file will be used instead of the default path.

Method summary:

- copy() - copies a truststore file and stashed it for later use.
- use { truststoreFile -> } - enables the usage of the previously copied truststore file. The truststore file which
    was extracted from the stash will be deleted once the body finishes.

Exemplary calls:

node 'master' {
    truststore.copy()
}
node 'docker' {
    truststore.use { truststoreFile ->
        javaOrMvn "-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=${truststoreFile} -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit"
    }
}
