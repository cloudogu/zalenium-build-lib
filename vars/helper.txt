- generateZaleniumJobName() - deprecated - use 'generateJobName()' instead

- generateJobName() - creates a jobname unique to the current Jenkins job. For the 99th Jenkins build of the job
  "ACME" the job name would be "ACME-99".

- findHostName() - returns the host name of the current Jenkins node. This is usually needed for getting the FQDN of the
  Cloudogu EcoSystem instance which runs the Jenkins master node.
